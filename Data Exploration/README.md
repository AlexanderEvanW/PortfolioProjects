## COVID death percentage in Indonesia

```sql
SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE Location like '%indo%'
ORDER BY 3
```

During the early stages of COVID, the death percentage started at a high rate of 8% but gradually decreased to 2.7% in the following year.

## Countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations

```sql
SELECT Location, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, population, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS CovidPercentage
FROM coviddeaths
GROUP BY Location, population
ORDER BY CovidPercentage DESC
```

## World's total cases, total deaths, and death percentage

```sql
SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS TotalCases, SUM(new_deaths) AS TotalDeaths, SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM coviddeaths
WHERE Continent != ''
```

## Total vaccinations and the percentage of the population vaccinated

```sql
WITH PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Population, New_Vaccinations, TotalVaccinations)
as
(
SELECT dea.Continent, dea.location, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (Partition BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location) as TotalVaccinations
FROM covidvaccinations AS vac
JOIN coviddeaths AS dea
  ON dea.Location = vac.Location
  AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.Continent != ''
ORDER BY 2,3
)
SELECT *, (TotalVaccinations/Population)*100 AS PercentPopulationVaccinated
FROM PopvsVac
```
