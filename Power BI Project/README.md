# Power BI Project

**In this project, we will use the data professional survey dataset. We will clean and transform the data using Power BI, and then use it to create a Power BI dashboard.**

## ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning

### Simplify the 'other' answers in the job title, favorite programming language, country, and industry columns

The answers people provide are so varied that it's hard to visualize.

We will simplify and standardize all the 'other' answers using the split column by delimiter. Here's the outcome:

### Create an average salary column

Created an average salary column to make it more usable. This was achieved by using the split column to separate digits from non-digits, followed by creating a custom column using a formula to calculate the average salary.
