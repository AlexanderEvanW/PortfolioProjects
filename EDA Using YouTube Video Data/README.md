# ðŸ“º Exploratory Data Analysis Using Youtube Video Data

In this project, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis using YouTube video data from the Manchester United Channel.

The complete project can be viewed at [Link](https://github.com/AlexanderEvanW/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/EDA%20Using%20YouTube%20Video%20Data/EDA%20YouTube%20Video%20Data.ipynb).

## Objective
Within this project, I would like to explore the following:
- Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain channel video data
- Doing Exploratory Data Analysis to answer question such as:
  - What does the distribution of views look like?
  - Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
  - Does the duration of a video matter for it to receive more views?
  - Is there any terms in video title that potentially impact video views?

## Tools
Python for Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Dataset
I created my own dataset using the Google Youtube Data API version 3.0. First, I created a project on the Google Developers Console and requested an authorization credential (API key). After that, I enabled the YouTube API for my application, allowing me to send API requests to YouTube API services. Then, I visited YouTube and retrieved the channel ID that I wanted to include. Then, I created the functions for getting the channel statistics via the API.

## Conclusions
